Generic single-database configuration.

To create a new version automatically based on the models defined in db/models, do the following:

1. Start the algorithms container (`docker-compose up algorithms` in the root directory)
2. Open a shell in the algorithms container
3. Run `alembic -c db/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "your message"`
4. That will create a new version in /db/alembic/versions. Copy that back over to the host
